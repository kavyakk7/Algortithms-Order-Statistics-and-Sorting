Programs:
1. Find kth smallest in an array of n elements
2. Find top k smallest elements in an array of n elements
3. Heap Sort
4. Quick Sort - Classical (Pivot = first element of the array)
5. Quick Sort - Randomized (Pivot = random element of the array)
6. Quick Sort - Median of 3 heuristics (Pivot = median of 3 random elements of the array)
7. Quick Sort - Optimized (Hybrid with Insertion sort)
8. Built-in Sort provided in C++ library

- ALgorithms designed in C++.
- Tested the performance of these programs for arrays ranging from size 10 to as large as 10^6.
- Data generated with Normally and Uniformly distributed values.
- Graphs plotted using Python.
